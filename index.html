                <p>
                In my opinion, what defines a good front-end developer is one that has skilled knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS with a vast understanding of User design thinking as theyâ€™ll be building web interfaces with accessibility in mind. They should also be excited to learn, as the world of Front-End Development keeps evolving.
